  - In a land steeped in myths and legends, there was a time the Yoruba people worshipped
    Sango, the god of thunder and lightning, with great reverence.
  - But as generations passed, Sango's name faded from their lips and his memory
    was all but forgotten. Sango was left alone, with no one to call upon him or
    remember his mighty deeds.
  - However, fate has a way of intervening, and when a great warrior seeks Sango's
    blessings for a battle, the god sees a chance to make a comeback and reclaim
    his rightful place in the pantheon.
  - Filled with a burning desire for venegeance, Sango possesses the warrior, imbuing
    him with his divine powers, and sends him on a dangerous mission to collect sacred
    items from an evil forest in order to perform six rituals. Only by doing so could
    Sango be brought back to life.
  - With the warrior's help, the god plans to avenge himself against those who have
    forgotten him...
